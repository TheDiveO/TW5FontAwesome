# TW5FontAwesome

Supports embedding [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) in [TiddlyWiki 5](http://tiddlywiki.com).
There is no need to install this font into your operating system. The font is already embedded in this TiddlyWiki 5
customization instead, so nothing to install at all. Please see the demo for details on how to easily install Font
Awesome support into your existing TiddlyWiki 5 instances. It's basically a simple drag&amp;drop operation.
