There is no need to install this font into your operating system. The font is already embedded in this TiddlyWiki 5 customization instead, so nothing to install at all. Please see the demo for details on how to easily install Font Awesome support into your existing TiddlyWiki 5 instances. It's basically a simple drag&amp;drop operation.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
